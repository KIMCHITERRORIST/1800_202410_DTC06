## 5. Known Bugs and Limitations
Here are some known bugs:

* graph doesnt display numbers on page load. must be clicked first to view the values
* Names of recipes and categories cannot be changed due to their names being their collection id within firebase. this is a limitation within firebase to not allow collection id/names be changed
* the page will sometimes load the modal by accident. case being is the 
* 

## 6. Features for Future
What we'd like to build in the future:
* More compatability for people looking to gain wieght. Had to focus on weight loss for the Goal calories reduction logic.
* add more style to overall app. we did not use any fonts and could use graphics for the macros on the individual recipe pages. 
* support pages, lost password pages, contact page. 
* social aspect where you and your friends can see your achievements and "duel eachother for a week to see who is more consistent"
* "quest/achievement log" where if you do a positive thing it will come up as an entry. ex completed work out and a thumbs up icon, or completed todays calorie quest and date with a thumbs up
* connecting with API like the food library API from USDA and figuring out how to connect with smart watches (daunting task from first glance)
